# Piano-Keyboard-App-Project
This project is coded fully with python and SQL. It is a fully functional piano that has a teacher student feedback system incorporated into it.

The piano application supports volume and octave sliders, instrument selectors, recording and playback. Note: only two instruments can be selected form the instrument selector feature, piano works correctly, but because the guitar mode only contains wave files for the first two octaves, certain features, such as higher and lower octaves, and the playabck feature are restricted to only the piano mode.

key binds are also supported, there is a button that toggles the key bind labels for the user so that they know what keyboard character corresponds to what note on the piano.

If you want to use my program, you need download the folder called 'wavs'

If you want to go and try the piano GUI straight away, run the file, 'piano_gui.py'.
The 'login_and_menu_windows.py' file is where my actual project starts. This version of my application uses local databases
feel free to view any of the SQL tables in GitHub SQL viewer, login information can be seen there. 
Depending on which login you use, and whose credentials (teacher or student), you will have access to different menus and features.

Thank you, 
happy playing
